# The KegAIEngine dump!
A dumpster for LLM-related experiments ran on pretty much ridiculously tight budgets. Brought to you some shmuck who likes to bang electronic rocks together and see sparks fly, after spending a few hours a day reading on how to bang those rocks juuust the right way. An opportunity also to learn a thing or two about consumer level AI software too, because corpo stuff can only get you so far without having you hemorrage some cash along the way.
