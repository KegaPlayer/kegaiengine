# The KegAIEngine archive!
This is an archive. A dumpster for LLM-related experiments ran on pretty much ridiculously tight budgets. Brought to you some shmuck who likes to bang electronic rocks together and see sparks fly, after spending a few hours a day reading on how to bang those rocks juuust the right way. 
An opportunity also to learn a thing or two about how one handles consumer level AI software too, because corpo stuff can only get you so far without having you hemorrage some very serious cash along the way.

*Quality and efficiency may vary wildly, so discretion while exploring is adviced*
